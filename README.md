For Developers
--------------
If you want to fork this and extend it yourself, feel free to do so.

You should find the code very interesting, but here's some notes:
* Look for the variable o_chatcmds if you want to add any commands. The syntax is

```javascript
var o_chatcmds = {
	'/commandname': {
		f: f_yourCommandfunction,
		needsPerm: true/false
	}, ...
};
```

* If you want to add any init code, do so in the `init()` function. By default, it will initialize the following:
	1. send online message
	2. add the event listeners
	3. mute the player

Oh, and a message to the devs at plug.dj: Please, please, please *update your API documentation*, it was a pain reverse-engineering that minified JS code ;)
